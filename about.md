Hi there!

My name is Laura and I'm a full stack web developer.
  
I currently work at Movebubble, a London-based start up which is making renting easier in the city, across our two mobile app products. 

**My Story**
    
Prior to this, I used to work as in... dare I say it? Investment banking. It took two years before I realised I wasn't fooling anyone, myself included, into thinking I found it interesting. Eager to learn a skill for the modern age, I enrolled at Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp and became a developer. 

When I'm not tapping away at my Macbook, you might find me on my bike, baking in the kitchen or practising yoga to stretch out after a long day.
